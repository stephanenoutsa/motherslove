        <i><u>For children over 6 months</u></i>\n
        The management of their severe malnutrition is divided in 2 phases: the Stabilization phase
        and the Rehabilitation phase.\n
        \t<i><b>i) Stabilization Phase</b></i>\n
        \t\t<b>It is worth noting that by the end of the second day following the diagnosis, the child
    should have been taken to the nearest health care facility for proper medical care.</b>\n
        \t\tThe stabilization is done using F75, a modified milk feed diet to treat the immediate
        complications of malnutrition.\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to prepare F75 at home:</b>\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 35g of milk (about 8 table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 70g of sugar (about 16 cubes)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 20g of oil, Mayor or Azur (1 table spoon or 1 tea spoon)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 35g of Bledina or Cerelac (about 8 table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 10ml of multivitamins or 1 sachet of Genesvit junior\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Mix the above components in 1l of clean water.\n
        \t\t<b>NB:The F75 prepared as shown above should be stored in a fridge and placed in warm water
        before each feed.</b>\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to give F75 to the child</b>\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 1-2:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Two times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>11ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 3-5:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Three times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>16ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 6 onwards:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Four times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>22ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<b>*Quantity/kg = corresponding figure for day x weight of child in kg</b>\n\n
        \t\tFeed the child from a cup or bowl using a spoon, or better still, a syringe (<b>Without
    the needle</b>).\n\n
        \t\t<b>Monitoring</b>\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Always record amount of feed given and leftover.\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Take note if child vomits.\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Check for increased respiratory rate, that is, child breathes faster than normal.
        If it is the case, <b>you should see a doctor.</b>\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 How many times does the child pass stool in a day? Are the stools soft, watery or
        normal?\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Check for signs of improvement such as:\n
        \t\t\t\t* Return of appetite\n
        \t\t\t\t* Most or all of oedema (swelling) is gone\n\n
        \t<i><b>ii) Rehabilitation Phase</b></i>\n
        \t\t<b>NB: The doctor will inform parents when the child is ready to begin the rehabilitation phase.</b>\n
        \t\tThe rehabilitation phase is done using diluted F100.\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to prepare diluted F100 at home:</b>\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 110g of milk (about twenty four and a half table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 50g of sugar (about eleven and a half cubes)\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 About 2 table spoons of oil, Mayor or Azur\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 1 sachet of Genesvit junior\n
        \t\t\t\u2022 Mix all the above in 1l of water, then add 300ml of water.\n\n
        \t\t<b>NB: The F100 prepared as shown above should be stored in a fridge and placed in warm
        water before each feed.</b>\n\n
        <b>Other Aspects of Management</b>\n
        Milk feeds aside (F75 and F100), the child also needs:\n
        \t\u2022 Lots of tenderness, love and care.\n
        \t\u2022 A cheerful/happy environment.\n
        \t\u2022 5 to 30 minutes of play time each day.\n\n
        <b><u>A Malnourished Child with Diarrhoea</u></b>\n
        \t\u2022 If a malnourished child has diarrhoea, they are considered to have some (moderate)
        dehydration.\n

        \u2022 Give treatment according to treatment Plan A (No (Mild) Dehydration).\n
        \u2022 ORS is effective for most children with persistent diarrhoea. However, if the child does not
        tolerate ORS (i.e. there is an increase in stool volume, thirst or worsening of signs of dehydration),
        such children should be given treatment <b>at a hospital or health centre</b> until ORS can be tolerated
        without worsening of the diarrhoea.\n
        \u2022 <b>Antibiotics treatment is NOT NECESSARY</b> unless there is evidence of an intestinal or
        non intestinal infection.\n\n
        <b>Feeding</b>\n
        \t\u2022 Reduce the amount of milk in the child\'s diet temporarily.\n
        \t\u2022 Continue breastfeeding more often and longer by day and night.\n
        \t\u2022 If the child is taking some other form of milk, replace animal milk with fermented milk
        like yogurt which contains less lactose and is well tolerated.\n
        \t\u2022 If the above mentioned replacement is not possible, reduce animal milk to a maximum of
        50ml/kg (i.e. 50 x child\'s weight in kg) in 24 hours.\n
        \t\u2022 Formula-fed children that are older than 4 months should start taking in solid foods.\n
        \t\u2022 Give frequent small feeds, at least 6 times per day.\n\n

        As the cervix begins to get thin and dilate (open), a pink or bloody substance could be
        discharged.\n
        You might also see a “plug” of mucus. This can happen several days before, or at the beginning
        of labour.\n\n
        <b>Ruptured Membranes</b>\n
        This manifests as a gush or slow leak of amniotic fluid from the vagina. If this happens, you
        should immediately report to the hospital.\n\n
        <b>Contractions</b>\n
        When labor begins, the contractions feel like cramps. They become stronger, get closer together,
        and last longer.\n
        Usually, first-time mothers come to the hospital when there is an interval of five minutes
        between contractions (for at least 1-2 hours), each lasting 45-60 seconds.\n
        Second or third-time mothers come in when there is an interval of ten minutes between contractions
        which don’t go away even when you rest.\n\n

    <string name="pain_management_text" formatted="false">
        There are many effective and helpful ways of reducing the amount of pain you feel when you have
        contractions. The effect varies from woman to woman, and often a combination of techniques are
        used to achieve this.\n
        These techniques help you avoid medications, they are easy to do, and they give personal satisfaction.\n
        Some of these techniques are:\n\n
        \t\u2022 Childbirth preparation classes. Learning about childbirth has been proven to decrease anxiety.
        This is one of the activities during ANC. Women mostly learn breathing exercises that decrease
        labour pain.\n
        \t\u2022 Help from a supportive individual. Either a partner or close relative/friend is very valuable
        to help with your comfort and emotional support throughout the labour experience.\n
        \t\u2022 Being active during labour rather than staying in bed. Position changes like walking, squatting,
        sitting, moving the hands and knees, and using a birthing ball can all be helpful.\n
        \t\u2022 Pleasant surroundings - music, dim lights and aromatherapy.\n
        \t\u2022 Taking a warm water bath or shower may help reduce labour pain.\n\n
        <b>AVOID DRINKING TRADITIONAL CONCOCTIONS OR HONEY PRIOR TO/DURING LABOUR. THESE SUBSTANCES

        The postpartum period (period after delivery) is the six week period after child birth, during
        which body tissues which have undergone changes during pregnancy return to their pre pregnancy
        state. It is also known as the puerperium. Women have to be aware of the course of these changes
        so as to reduce unnecessary fear and anxiety in them while the changes occur, and also so that
        they could quickly be aware if complications arise.

        <b>1. BREASTFEEDING</b>\n
        \t<b>1.1 Importance of Breastfeeding</b>\n
        \t\tThe establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding should be one of the major goals of good
        postpartum care. Human breast milk is the optimal food for newborn infants. It is clean. When
        other foods are given, especially by bottle feeding, it is very hard to keep things clean enough
        to prevent the baby from getting diarrhea and other sicknesses. The temperature of breast milk
        is always right.\n
        \t\tNot only is the breast milk nutritive, but it is also immune protective as it contains antibodies
        which protect the body against infections.\n
        \t\tModified cow milk preparations or “formula” have become readily available. These preparations
        are close to human milk in nutrient quantity, but still very different in quality, and lacking
        in immune factors.\n
        \t\tIn developing countries artificial feeding is associated with a much higher infant morbidity
        and mortality than breastfeeding, primarily caused by infections and malnutrition.\n\n
        \t<b>1.2 Initiation of Breastfeeding</b>\n
        \t\tIt is recommended that the baby is given to the mother to hold immediately after delivery,
        to provide skin-to-skin contact and for the baby to start suckling as soon as he/she shows signs
        of readiness - normally within 30 minutes to 1 hour after birth. Early skin-to-skin contact
        and suckling are associated with more affectionate behavior of mothers towards their infants;
        mothers who start to breastfeed early have fewer problems with breastfeeding.\n\n
        \t<b>1.3 Positioning and Attaching the Baby to the Breast</b>\n
        \t\tIf the baby is incorrectly attached, milk is not effectively removed and the nipple may
        be damaged by friction as the teat is drawn in and out of the mouth. If the attachment is not
        corrected, sore nipples and engorgement are more common developments, the baby may get insufficient
        milk, and the mother is more likely to stop breastfeeding.\n
        \t\tGood breast feeding positions are illustrated below:
    </string>
    <string name="breastfeeding_image_description">Breastfeeding positions</string>
    <string name="changes_after_delivery_text2" formatted="false">
        \t<b>1.4 The Need to Avoid Supplementary Feeds</b>\n
        \t\tIn some hospitals it is common practice to give breastfed babies supplements of formula
        or glucose water while lactation is becoming established. This practice is unnecessary because
        a healthy baby does not need extra fluids or feeds before breastfeeding is established, and
        it is harmful because bottle feeding may interfere with the initiation and continuation of
        breastfeeding. Babies who have had their appetite satisfied with an artificial feed may lose
        interest in trying to breastfeed.\n
        \t\tWHO recommends that infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to at least
        4 and if possible 6 months of age. Breastfeeding should be given as often as the child desires,
        day and night, at least eight times in 24 hours. Often a sharp decline in breastfeeding occurs
        in the weeks after delivery.\n\n
        \t<b>1.5 Consequences of Not Breastfeeding</b>\n
        \t\tIf the baby is not put to the breasts early enough, the breasts become engorged about the
        third to fourth day after delivery because of the increased production of milk at this time.
        This will cause discomfort to the mother and can later predispose her to infections.\n
        \t\tThis is also the reason why women who lose their babies during labor are given medication
        to suppress lactation.\n\n
        <b>2. After Pains</b>\n
        This refers to intermittent uterine contractions felt by a breastfeeding mother in the region
        of the lower abdomen in the course of breastfeeding her baby.\n
        This is normal and is as a result of physiological processes occurring in the body during the
        time of breastfeeding. They can be relieved by taking simple pain medication.\n\n
        <b>3. Return to Normal Size of the Uterus</b>\n
        The uterus extends above the level of the umbilicus in most women immediately after delivery.
        It should gradually reduce daily after delivery with the result being that by the end of the second
        week it should no longer be felt. This is a natural process. As such, practices such as tying
        the stomach tight or applying very hot water unto it are strongly discouraged.\n
        Failure of the uterus to reduce in size is not normal, especially if it is associated with fever.
        This should be reported to a health personnel if noticed.\n\n
        <b>4. Lochia</b>\n
        During these same 2 weeks, a woman should experience vaginal discharges called lochia. For the
        first few days after delivery (1 – 5 days) the lochia appears red. After 4 – 5 days it becomes
        pale in color. After about the 10th day it becomes yellowish-white in color.\n
        If lochia persists, or develops an offensive odor, or fails to follow the above pattern of color
        change, it is not normal and should be reported to a health personnel.\n\n
        <b>5. Return of Menses</b>\n
        The time of return of the menses after a normal delivery is quite varied. Many women who are
        not breastfeeding may resume normal menses about 6 weeks after delivery. For mothers who are
        breastfeeding, the picture is different. Those who introduce supplemental feeding to breastfeeding
        quite early may have their menses return before 6 weeks. The women who do exclusive breastfeeding
        could have their menses delay for as long as six months. However they should be aware that they
        could still get pregnant despite this absence of menstruation.

    <string name="title_activity_heafter_delivery">Health Education After Delivery</string>
    <string name="heafter_delivery_text" formatted="false">
        This is a very important part of management after delivery as women are taught ways of keeping
        themselves and their babies healthy.\n
        Information is also provided for birth spacing in subsequent pregnancies.\n
        Before leaving the health facility, each woman should receive education on the following:\n\n
        <b>CARE OF THE NEWBORN</b>\n
        \t\u2022 Immediately after birth, mothers should ensure that their children receive vitamin K injection
        to prevent them from developing hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Also, to prevent a newborn\'s
        eyes from dangerous conjunctivitis, mothers should ensure that a little tetracycline eye ointment
        or 1% silver nitrate is dropped in their baby\’s eyes after birth.\n
        \t\u2022 Protect the baby from cold, but also from too much heat. Dress the baby as warmly as you
        feel like dressing yourself.\n\n
        <b>HYGIENE OF THE BABY</b>\n
        \t\u2022 Change the baby\’s diapers (nappy) each time he wets or dirties them. If the skin gets sore,
        change the diaper more often, or better still, leave it off.\n
        \t\u2022 Special care should be shown to keeping the umbilical cord clean. Mothers should be taught
        how to wash their babies and how to clean the umbilical region especially. After the cord drops
        off, bathe the baby daily with soap and warm water.\n
        \t\u2022 If there are flies or mosquitoes, cover the baby\’s crib with mosquito netting or a thin cloth.\n
        \t\u2022 Persons with open sores, colds, sore throat, tuberculosis or other infectious illnesses
        should not touch or go near the baby.\n
        \t\u2022 Keep the baby in a clean place away from smoke and dust.\n\n
        <b>HYGIENE OF THE MOTHER</b>\n
        Mothers should be encouraged to bathe at least twice a day, or have at least 2 bed baths for
        women who gave birth through caesarian deliveries. The breast area should especially be kept
        clean. Mothers should always wash their hands before feeding their babies. Pads should be changed
        once they are wet, and women should complain if they notice an offensive discharge.\n\n
        <b>VACCINATION</b>\n
        Mothers should ensure that their babies receive the required vaccines at birth and thereafter.
        Mothers should also endeavor to receive all their tetanus toxoid vaccines as scheduled. (Check
        the section on “Immunization” for details)\n\n
        <b>EDUCATION ON A DISEASE WHICH CAN BE TRANSMITTED FROM MOTHER TO CHILD</b>\n
        Before being discharged from the hospital, women shall be educated on at least one disease which
        can be transmitted from mother to child, or on prevention of certain pregnancy complications.
        Women should be keen on reminding their doctors/nurses/midwives, in case these forget.\n\n
        <b>FAMILY PLANNING</b>\n
        Mothers will also be told when it would be appropriate for them to plan their next pregnancy,
        if that is their desire. To achieve this, they shall be introduced to various methods of contraception,
        from which they will choose one they are comfortable with.\n
        Mothers who no longer desire pregnancy will also be proposed methods they can use.\n
        The aim is to have adequate spacing among children, for a healthy growth.\n\n
        <b>RENDEZVOUS</b>\n
        It is recommended that mothers report to the hospital with their babies six weeks after delivery
        for checkup.
