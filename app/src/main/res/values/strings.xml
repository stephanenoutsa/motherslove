        breast milk. If that is not possible, artificial milk (tin milk) or F75 should be given either
        alone or together with expressed breast milk.\n
        Care of the malnourished child should continue at a health centre, so <b>PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR</b>
        as soon as possible.\n\n
        <i><u>For children over 6 months</u></i>\n
        The management of their severe malnutrition is divided in 2 phases: the Stabilization phase
        and the Rehabilitation phase.\n
        \t<i><b>i) Stabilization Phase</b></i>\n
        \t\t<b>It is worth noting that by the end of the second day following the diagnosis, the child
    should have been taken to the nearest health care facility for proper medical care.</b>\n
        \t\tThe stabilization is done using F75, a modified milk feed diet to treat the immediate
        complications of malnutrition.\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to prepare F75 at home:</b>\n
        \t\t\t- 35g of milk (about 8 table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t- 70g of sugar (about 16 cubes)\n
        \t\t\t- 20g of oil, Mayor or Azur (1 table spoon or 1 tea spoon)\n
        \t\t\t- 35g of Bledina or Cerelac (about 8 table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t- 10ml of multivitamins or 1 sachet of Genesvit junior\n
        \t\t\t- Mix the above components in 1l of clean water.\n
        \t\t<b>NB:The F75 prepared as shown above should be stored in a fridge and placed in warm water
        before each feed.</b>\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to give F75 to the child</b>\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 1-2:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Two times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>11ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 3-5:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Three times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>16ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<i><u>Days 6 onwards:</u></i>\n
        \t\t\t<i>Frequency(How often to feed): </i>Four times each hour.\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per feed: </i>22ml\n
        \t\t\t<i>Quantity/kg per day: </i>130ml\n\n
        \t\t\t<b>*Quantity/kg = corresponding figure for day x weight of child in kg</b>\n\n
        \t\tFeed the child from a cup or bowl using a spoon, or better still, a syringe (<b>Without
    the needle</b>).\n\n
        \t\t<b>Monitoring</b>\n
        \t\t\t- Always record amount of feed given and leftover.\n
        \t\t\t- Take note if child vomits.\n
        \t\t\t- Check for increased respiratory rate, that is, child breathes faster than normal.
        If it is the case, <b>you should see a doctor.</b>\n
        \t\t\t- How many times does the child pass stool in a day? Are the stools soft, watery or
        normal?\n
        \t\t\t- Check for signs of improvement such as:\n
        \t\t\t\t* Return of appetite\n
        \t\t\t\t* Most or all of oedema (swelling) is gone\n\n
        \t<i><b>ii) Rehabilitation Phase</b></i>\n
        \t\t<b>NB: The doctor will inform parents when the child is ready to begin the rehabilitation phase.</b>\n
        \t\tThe rehabilitation phase is done using diluted F100.\n\n
        \t\t<b>How to prepare diluted F100 at home:</b>\n
        \t\t\t- 110g of milk (about twenty four and a half table spoons)\n
        \t\t\t- 50g of sugar (about eleven and a half cubes)\n
        \t\t\t- About 2 table spoons of oil, Mayor or Azur\n
        \t\t\t- 1 sachet of Genesvit junior\n
        \t\t\t- Mix all the above in 1l of water, then add 300ml of water.\n\n
        \t\t<b>NB: The F100 prepared as shown above should be stored in a fridge and placed in warm
        water before each feed.</b>\n\n
        <b>Other Aspects of Management</b>\n
        Milk feeds aside (F75 and F100), the child also needs:\n
        \t- Lots of tenderness, love and care.\n
        \t- A cheerful/happy environment.\n
        \t- 5 to 30 minutes of play time each day.\n\n
        <b><u>A Malnourished Child with Diarrhoea</u></b>\n
        \t- If a malnourished child has diarrhoea, they are considered to have some (moderate)
        dehydration.\n
        \t- This is treated using ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for the Malnourished) at a hospital
        or health centre. <b>PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR!!!</b>

        - If not exclusively breastfed, give either <b>ORS</b> or <b>CLEAN WATER</b>.\n

        \t\t* Less than 2 years: 50 - 100ml after every loose stool\n
        \t\t* Greater than 2 years: 100 - 200ml after every loose stool\n

        - Mother should have two extra packets of ORS or already locally prepared ORS at home.\n\n
        <b>III.\tGive Zinc Supplements</b>\n
        Give zinc supplements as follows:\n
        \t* Less than 6 months: 1/2 tablet (10mg) per day for 10 - 14 days.\n

        - If there is no improvement after 5 days, <b>take the child to a hospital or health centre.</b>\n\n

        - Give treatment according to treatment Plan A (No (Mild) Dehydration).\n
        - ORS is effective for most children with persistent diarrhoea. However, if the child does not
        tolerate ORS (i.e. there is an increase in stool volume, thirst or worsening of signs of dehydration),
        such children should be given treatment <b>at a hospital or health centre</b> until ORS can be tolerated
        without worsening of the diarrhoea.\n
        - <b>Antibiotics treatment is NOT NECESSARY</b> unless there is evidence of an intestinal or
        non intestinal infection.\n\n
        <b>Feeding</b>\n
        \t- Reduce the amount of milk in the child\'s diet temporarily.\n
        \t- Continue breastfeeding more often and longer by day and night.\n
        \t- If the child is taking some other form of milk, replace animal milk with fermented milk
        like yogurt which contains less lactose and is well tolerated.\n
        \t- If the above mentioned replacement is not possible, reduce animal milk to a maximum of
        50ml/kg (i.e. 50 x child\'s weight in kg) in 24 hours.\n
        \t- Formula-fed children that are older than 4 months should start taking in solid foods.\n
        \t- Give frequent small feeds, at least 6 times per day.\n\n
        <b>Follow Up</b>\n
        \t- Take the child back to the hospital or health centre after 5 days at most if the diarrhoea
        worsens or other problems develop.\n
        \t- Check for signs of dehydration and the child\'s body temperature to ensure there is no fever.\n
        \t- If the child has gained weight and has less than 3 loose stools per day, they may resume
        the normal diet for their age.

        - Child should be assessed and treated according to Plan B (Some Dehydration) or Plan C (Severe
        Dehydration) depending on the level of dehydration\n
        - ORS is effective for most children with persistent diarrhoea. However, if the child does not
        tolerate ORS (i.e. there is an increase in stool volume, thirst or worsening of signs of dehydration),
        such children should be given treatment <b>at a hospital or health centre</b> until ORS can be tolerated
        without worsening of the diarrhoea.\n
        - <b>Antibiotics treatment is NOT NECESSARY</b> unless there is evidence of an intestinal or

        <b>Feeding</b>\n
        <i><u>Children less than 6 months</u></i>\n
        \t- Breastfeeding should be continued for as often and long as the child wants.\n
        \t- Other foods should not be given for as long as 4 to 6 hours to allow for rehydration to be
        done, depending on the level of dehydration.\n\n
        <i><u>Children over 6 months</u></i>\n
        \t- Restart feeding as soon as the child can eat. Feed the child at least 6 times a day to ensure
        they meet adequate energy requirements.\n\n
        <b>Follow Up</b>\n
        Check the following to ensure that the child is improving:\n
        \t- Weight gain: Increase in weight for 3 consecutive days shows favourable response to treatment.\n
        \t- Temperature: Absence of fever shows appropriate response to treatment.\n
        \t- Number of stools per day: Passage of less than 3 loose stools per day shows favourable
        response to treatment.\n
        \t- Food taken in: Increase in quantity of food taken in by the child shows favourable response
        to treatment.
