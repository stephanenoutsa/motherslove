        <b>Treatment is given at home</b>\n\n
        <b>How to prepare Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at home: </b>In 1 litre of clean water, add
        8 cubes of sugar + 1 teaspoon of salt + 1 lemon (squeezed), then mix properly so that the sugar
        and salt dissolve.\n\n
        The treatment at home should follow the active rules listed below:\n
        \t- Continue feeding\n
        \t- Give extra fluids\n
        \t- Give zinc supplements\n
        \t- When to go to the hospital or health centre\n\n
        <b>I.\tContinue Feeding</b>\n
        - If the child is breastfed, feed more frequently or longer.\n
        - If exclusively breastfed, give ORS or clean water in addition to breast milk.\n\n
        <b>II.\tGive Extra Fluids</b>\n
        - If not exclusively breastfed, give either <b>ORS</b> or <b>CLEAN WATER</b>.\n
        - To prevent dehydration, give as much fluid as the child will take, that is,\n
        \t\t* Less than 2 years: 50 - 100ml after every loose stool\n
        \t\t* Greater than 2 years: 100 - 200ml after every loose stool\n
        - Give small sips from a cup. If the child vomits, wait 10 minutes then continue more slowly. Continue
        administering extra fluids till diarrhoea reduces.\n
        - Mother should have two extra packets of ORS or already locally prepared ORS at home.\n\n
        <b>III.\tGive Zinc Supplements</b>\n
        Give zinc supplements as follows:\n
        \t* Less than 6 months: 1/2 tablet (10mg) per day for 10 - 14 days.\n
        \t* Greater than 6 months: 1 tablet (20mg) per day for 10 - 14 days.\n
        Dissolve the zinc tablet in breast milk, clean water or ORS before administering to the child.\n\n
        <b>IV.\t When to go to the Hospital or Health Centre</b>\n
        - If the child gets sicker, becomes unable to drink or breastfeed, develops a fever, or begins
        having blood in their stool, <b>take the child to a hospital or health centre as soon as possible.</b>\n
        - If there is no improvement after 5 days, <b>take the child to a hospital or health centre.</b>\n\n
        Administer the same treatment if the child suffers from similar diarrhoea again.

        - Give treatment according to treatment Plan A (No (Mild) Dehydration).\n
        - ORS is effective for most children with persistent diarrhoea. However, if the child does not

        such children should be given treatment <b>at a hospital or health centre</b> until ORS can be tolerated

        <b>Feeding</b>\n
        \t- Reduce the amount of milk in the child's diet temporarily.\n
        \t- Continue breastfeeding more often and longer by day and night.\n
        \t- If the child is taking some other form of milk, replace animal milk with fermented milk
        like yogurt which contains less lactose and is well tolerated.\n
        \t- If the above mentioned replacement is not possible, reduce animal milk to a maximum of
        50ml/kg (i.e. 50 x child's weight in kg) in 24 hours.\n
        \t- Formula-fed children that are older than 4 months should start taking in solid foods.\n
        \t- Give frequent small feeds, at least 6 times per day.\n\n
        <b>Follow Up</b>\n
        \t- Take the child back to the hospital or health centre after 5 days at most if the diarrhoea
        worsens or other problems develop.\n
        \t- Check for signs of dehydration and the child's body temperature to ensure there is no fever.\n
        \t- If the child has gained weight and has less than 3 loose stools per day, they may resume
        the normal diet for their age.

        \t- Temperature: Absence of fever shows appropriate response to treatment.\n
        \t- Number of stools per day: Passage of less than 3 loose stools per day shows favourable
        response to treatment.\n

        <b>Vaccination</b>\n
        - At birth, your baby should receive the Hepatitis B vaccine.\n
        - This vaccine should be followed up by an injection with antibodies against Hepatitis B.\n
        - Your baby will need another vaccine at ages 1 month, 2 months and 1 year. A booster is recommended
        for these vaccines at the age of 5 years.\n
        <b>
            * It is important for your baby to receive the vaccines because 9 out of 10 babies who get
            infected from their mothers go on to have chronic hepatitis.\n
            * When you go for routine vaccination according to the Expanded Program for Immunisation,
            inform the nurse of your status, emphasizing that your child is already receiving hepatitis
            vaccines.\n\n
            Feeding\n
        </b>
        It is safe for you to breastfeed your baby as long as he/she is receiving his/her vaccines.
